I've had a GitHub account for a long, long time. And a bit more recently, I'd also decided to snag myself a personalized `.dev` TLD from Google when they were new and fancy.

And then, well - you know: **Work. Life. Stuff. Things**

Never ended up getting to any of that, as most usually don't. So I figured today, why the hell not?

- Have GitHub account
- Get a free webpage under GitHub Pages
- Can make it fancy for free and pretty easily
- Have unused `.dev` domain
- Can wire it all together

So - I did. Even went so far as to whip together a [VSCode Remote - Docker](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) project for it and make it easy (more on that later).

Anyways, if you're here and you're reading this - thanks for taking the time. I have a lot of things to say about a lot of stuff - and hopefully you mind find it interesting or useful.
